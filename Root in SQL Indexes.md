# Root in SQL Indexes

In a **B-Tree or B+ Tree index** (which most SQL databases use under the hood), the **root node** is **automatically managed** by the database system. But to understand **how to determine the root**, let’s look at both the **theoretical concept** and **how you can observe it in practice**.

---

## 🔍 What is the Root in a B+ Tree?

- The **root node** is the **top-most node** in the B+ Tree.
- It contains **pointers to child nodes**, which may be **leaf nodes** (if the tree is shallow) or **intermediate nodes**.
- Every search begins at the root and follows pointers down to the leaves.

### 📘 Tree Structure Example

Let's say you create an index on `name`:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON customers(name);
```

Internally, the B+ Tree might look like this:

```plaintext
         [M]
       /     \
  [A-F]     [N-Z]
```

- `M` is the **root**.
- `A-F` and `N-Z` are **leaf nodes** (or could have more children).
- To find `'Eva'`, the DB starts at root `M` → goes to `[A-F]`.

The **root is defined by the structure of the tree**, and it **may change over time** as:

- New rows are inserted
- Tree is split
- Index is rebuilt or reorganized

## ✅ How to Determine the Root Node in Practice

While you can’t _directly_ view the root node in standard SQL, **you can analyze and infer index structure** using database tools.

### 🔹 1. MySQL (with `SHOW INDEX` and `EXPLAIN`)

```sql
SHOW INDEX FROM customers;
```

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

➡️ `EXPLAIN` shows if an index is used and the **type of lookup** (e.g., `index`, `range`, `ref`, etc.), though it doesn't expose the internal root.

### 🔹 2. PostgreSQL (with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and `bt_page_items`)

- You can use:

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

- For advanced inspection:

```sql
-- Enable page inspection module
CREATE EXTENSION pageinspect;

-- View B-Tree structure (PostgreSQL-specific):
SELECT * FROM bt_page_items('idx_name', 1); -- page 1 often contains root
```

> `bt_page_items` will show you the layout of a specific page — the root is typically page `1`, but can change.

---

### 🔹 3. SQL Server (with `sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats`)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats (
    DB_ID('YourDatabaseName'),
    OBJECT_ID('customers'),
    NULL, NULL, 'DETAILED'
);
```

This will show you the **tree depth** and other statistics. A tree depth of `1` means root = leaf. If depth = `>1`, root is at the top.

---

### 🔹 4. Oracle (with `DBMS_STATS` and `INDEX_STATS`)

Use:

```sql
ANALYZE INDEX idx_name VALIDATE STRUCTURE;
SELECT * FROM INDEX_STATS;
```

This shows B-Tree depth, root block, leaf blocks, etc.

## 🧠 Key Points

| Concept         | Explanation                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Root node       | First node at the top of the B+ Tree                                           |
| DB decides      | You **do not define** the root — the DB builds and adjusts it                  |
| Tree depth      | You can find **how deep** the tree is (helps infer root location)              |
| Page inspection | Some databases allow inspection of root/leaf pages (like PostgreSQL or Oracle) |

## 📌 TL;DR

- The **database engine determines and manages the root node** of the index automatically.
- You can **inspect** or **infer** root node structure using `EXPLAIN`, system views, and internal tools depending on the RDBMS.
- In PostgreSQL and Oracle, **page inspection** can even tell you the exact page acting as the root.
